## Overview
A simplistic router-based joke game. Fun for the whole family, except mostly just for dad.
https://meatstick.herokuapp.com/

## Description
Dadjoke is a simple game for people who appreciate jokes and enjoy mad-lib or fill-in-the-blank style games.  It's played in rounds.  The player is issued a prompt and can fill in their own answer.  Answers from each player are submitted and then players are allowed to vote (with emojis) on their favorites.  The results are tallied and returned to show the top voted answers.  

## Installation Instructions
If you would like to play or improve upon this game, feel free.  This project includes all the files you will need, including a package.json.  In your terminal, enter npm i to install the dev dependencies you will need locally. You're ready to go!

## Creating an Admin
Many tools are only useable by admins. However, all users are non-admin by default. In order to create an admin user you will need to go into your MongoDB and manually change your "role" to "admin" *after* you create an account.

## Credit goes to:
This is an original idea inspired by groan worthy dad jokesters everywhere.  We'd like to give thanks to our own dads for their quirks and eccentricities, which helped to shape us into humans who love a good dad joke.  We'd also like to credit our mothers for loving them anyway.
